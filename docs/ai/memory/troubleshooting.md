## MCP SDK has no 429 rate-limit handling — Status: open
**Problem**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` throws a plain `StreamableHTTPError` on 429 responses. It does not read `Retry-After` headers or implement automatic backoff. This is an SDK-level gap, not Kado-specific — all MCP servers returning 429 are affected.
**Impact**: MCP clients (Claude, custom agents) that don't add their own retry logic will crash or fail-fast on rate limits instead of waiting and retrying.
**Kado mitigation**: Server sends `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` on every response + `Retry-After` on 429. Clients must read these headers themselves. Reference implementation in `test/live/mcp-live.test.ts` (`probeRetryAfter()` + `callTool()` retry loop).
**Future**: Consider raising/making rate limit configurable, or contributing 429 handling upstream to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
